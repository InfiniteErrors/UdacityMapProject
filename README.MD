## Udacity Neighborhood Map Project
Welcome to my neighborhood map repository! This admittedly took me longer than expected to complete. But it was an AWESOME learning experience. The moments where I was done and had to really go back and read.watch a ton of reference material was invaluable.

### My Submission
My map is fixed on a city called Kelowna in British Columbia Canada. I've visited this town many times and have been to the majority of the local cafes in the area. I wanted to make a little app that people if the cafe had Wifi. How many times have you set out to a local cafe with your laptop to get some work done and they done have wifi üôÅ? Too many times in my experience.

### The App
My app displays a list of all the cafes in Kelowna and then you can click the filter to just the ones that have a Wifi connection. There is also a handy current weather report from [DarkSky.net](https://darksky.net/dev) .

### How to run the App?
1. [Click Here to Launch the App](www.google.ca)
2. Click the map markers check if they have Wifi or you want to see their name. Also you can use the button to filter the markers/names to cafes that only have Wifi.
